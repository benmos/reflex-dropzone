## Reflex Dropzone

Basic bindings to dropzone.js for use in Reflex Apps.

One my personal goals for this package is to act as an experiment in using the GHCJS FFI to wrap a third-party JS library.

### old-base vs improved-base
This is all working with GHCJS ghcjs-base 'old-base' for now (because that's what Reflex is currently using).
It will all need to be updated to 'improved-base' once that has stabilized and Reflex has been ported to it.
