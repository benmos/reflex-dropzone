## Reflex Dropzone

Very Primitive and incomplete wrapping of dropzone.js for use in Reflex Apps.

One of the goals of this package is to act as a proof-of-concept for using the GHCJS FFI to wrap a third-party JS library.

### old-base vs improved-base
This is all working with GHCJS ghcjs-base 'old-base' for now (because that's what Reflex is currently using).
It will all need to be updated to 'improved-base' once that has stabilized and Reflex has been ported to it.
